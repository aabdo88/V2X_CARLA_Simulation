Notes:

   * Certificate templates based on those provided by Green Hills Software / ISS for the
     October 2017 PlugFest.

   * Folder structure should match certificate batches provided by GHS / ISS.

   * RequestHash in AuthenticatedDownloadRequest likely not computed correctly.
       - Is currently HashedId8 of the SecuredAuthenticatedDownloadRequest,
         unsure what the correct message to hash is.
